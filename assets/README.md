## Introduction
Professional portfolios provide a lense for employers to view the works of prospective employees. The foundation of the professional portfolio utilizes html as the structure of the site and CSS to style the content and cosmetics of the portfolio. When employers want to sample a potential employee's previous work, they are able to load their portfolio, view the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, their resume, and how to contact them. Employers are able to click one of the links in the navigation to prompt the UI to scroll to the corresponding section. When viewing provided works, employers are able to view the label/name of the work, click on the image, and they are presented with the deployed application via the incripted link. Employers are able to resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices via a responsive layout that adapts to their viewport. 

## Usage

2. Select subheader sections, including "About Me," "Works," "Resume," and "Contact Me" to be navigated to website section.
3. Click on a listed example of work to be redirected to the deployed site for review.
4. Select the provided methods of contact information to reach out to the perspective employee.
